<h2>Welcome to Copyright Registry</h2>
<p style="margin: 20px 0; line-height: 1.6;">
    This platform allows artists, writers, and creators to register proof of ownership
    of their work on the blockchain. Once registered, you'll have immutable evidence
    that you created the work at a specific date and time.
</p>

<div class="work-card">
    <h3>🎨 How It Works</h3>
    <p><strong>1. Upload Your Work:</strong> Submit your file (image, document, music, etc.)</p>
    <p><strong>2. Blockchain Registration:</strong> We calculate a unique hash of your work and record it on the blockchain</p>
    <p><strong>3. Proof of Ownership:</strong> You receive a unique Work ID that proves you registered it first</p>
    <p><strong>4. Verification:</strong> Anyone can verify the authenticity of your work using the Work ID</p>
